# byandell-Tribal Organization
This organization contains my collaborative work with Tribes.
It is meant to have prototype material to share on projects.
Some of these repositories will be private to respect work in process that has not yet been agreed for release.
No private Tribal information will be in this organization.

The medicine wheel icon was copied from the [The Medicine Wheel (NPS)](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-medicine-wheel.htm)
where it is attributed to
[Pipestone Monument Park Ranger Gabrielle "Gabby" Drapeau](https://www.startribune.com/pipestone-national-monument-in-southwestern-minnesota-retells-its-story-from-a-native-perspective/600295625).
I have not yet been able to contact Gabby to formally ask for permission.
